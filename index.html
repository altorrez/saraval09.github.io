        <h2>About Me!</h2>
        <p>
            Hello everyone! My name is Sara Maneval. I am a 3D artist for a company in Tampa, Florida currently. I have a Bachelors Degree in Computer Animation graduating from Full Sail in 2012. I was born in Pennsylvania and raised in Montana.<br>
            I have loved Disney movies since I was a year old, for an hour at a time they helped me escape reality. As I got older I grew to love everything about computers as well. During my junior year in high school I was told that I needed to decide on what I should do with my life. It was then I decided to put my two passions together and make my life goal to work at Disney.<br> I went to two different colleges until I found Full Sail. I was hooked on the college campus life. I made plenty of friends that I still keep in contact with them and I am trying to get them a job where I am at as well! Everyone asks me why I haven't applied for Disney yet and my answer is simple, I am not ready to get to my life goal just yet. I want to experience different studios before I get my dream job. I also figured having two degrees when I graduate in a year and half with my second Bachelors Degree in Web Design and Development, it will increase my chances of working at other various studios. So ask me where I am at in about 10 years because maybe by then I will be in the studio for Disney or Pixar making the next big movie.

            <h2>Header</h2>
            <img src="images/header.PNG"  alt="header">
            <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
            <p>Designed for people who own a house and would like a custom garden pond. The target audience would be adults approximately between the ages of 25 and 65. A custom garden pond design would indicate that the                        the consumer would be middle to upper class.</p>
            <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
            <p>The client goal is revenue. They show images of ponds they created in hope to be hired by the user. The users needs are to find a client that can create a custom garden pond right in their own back yard and be affordable at the same time.</p>
            <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
            <p>When looking at the picture you see a relaxing, welcoming image. The word 'Laguna' catches your eye with the larger font, it is simple yet effective. The words 'garden pond design' is in between two                        lines which gives it a nice balance throughout the picture. </p>

            <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
            <p>The first thing you notice is the logo on the left hand side with an elegant font and a subtle change in color. The way the lines are setup for the navigation bar gives the appearance that they are                          buttons even though the lines don’t connect your eyes still connect them anyways. </p>

            <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
            <p>The design is simple yet effective. The header is stating exactly what you are signing up for the larger bold font. With the text in the input boxes, it makes things easier for the user to know what to                      expect when they press the big orange button after they are filled in.</p>

Looking at the services is their deal breaker on whether they will continue looking at the site or not.</p>
            <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
            <p>First thing you see is the bottom of a ladies head with bright red lipstick on the left side. There are feathers coming out from the top indicating she is wearing a head piece of some kind. It is an                         effective way to get the attention of the target audience. Even though your eyes are drawn to her you quickly look to the right to notice what they have to offer for their main services. The two thumbnails give a great representation of what they offer. </p>

            <p>Given that it is a blog, the target audience would be for a younger crowd approximately between the ages of 14 and 28. It is important to keep the website organized and well laid out in order for the younger crowd to stay interested. </p>

            <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
            <p>The dark background with a light font makes it very easy to read and understand. Having a profile picture on the left side the name makes it easier to know who the person writing is since we typically read left to right.</p>

            <p>The target audience would be for adults approximately between the ages of 18 and 55.Because older people are now making purchases online, it is best to make the font larger then normal. </p>

            <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
            <p>The icons really help balance the CTA as a whole. Most people know what those stand for so they don’t really need to focus on the words. Having them yellow really helps the user to know where to look.The arrows pointing to the right help the user know that it is a button along with the rounded edges</p>

            <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
            <p>The images running horizontal on the bottom is a great way to look at the clients. They arent all dressed the same indicating the company is for younger crowds and not for CEOs. I believe the “about us” header could be a little bigger to make it stand out more. </p>

            <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
            <p>The color and font of the addresses and phone number makes it a little hard to read on a brown background. The headers for each box shouldn’t be the same size as the content below. The form itself is basic and easy to use. It is spaced properly and easy to read.</p>

            <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>

            <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
            <p>The icon for each social media site indicates that it will be for a younger crowd since all they are using is icons and no text indicating what those icons stand for. The 3 columns to the right, show that there will be listing that couldnt fit in the navigation bar and will help the user navigate even more throughout the website.</p>
