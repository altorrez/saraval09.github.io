        <h2>About Me!</h2>
    <p id="aboutMe">
        Hello everyone! My name is Sara Maneval. I am a 3D artist for a company in Tampa Florida currently. I have a Bachelors in Computer Animation from Full Sail back in 2012 on campus. I was born in Pennsylvania, but raised in Montana.<br>
        Since I was a year old I have always loved Disney movies. They helped me escape reality for an hour at a time. As I got older I grew to love everything about computers as well. My junior year in high school we were told that we need to decide what we want to do with our lives. I decided to put two passions together and make my life goal to work at Disney.<br> I went to two different colleges until I found Full Sail. I was hooked on the life style right away. I made plenty of friends that I still keep in contact with today and I am trying to get them a job where I am at as well! Everyone asks me why I haven't applied for Disney yet and my answer is simple. I am not ready to get to my life goal just yet. I want to experience different studios before I get there and I figured with two degrees under my belt in a year and half my chances of working at different studios are greater then just having one. So ask me again in about 10 years because maybe by then I will be in the studio for Disney or Pixar making the next big movie.

            <img src="images/header.PNG"  alt="header" id="header-image">
                <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
                <p>Designed for people who own a house and would like a custom garden pond. The target audience would be adults approximately between the ages of 25 and 65. A custom garden pond design would indicate that the                        the consumer would be middle to upper class.</p>
                <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
                <p>The client is showing images of ponds they created to be hired by the user. The users need is to find a pond they enjoy and to have in their own back yard.</p>
                <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
                <p>When looking at the picture you see a relaxing, welcoming image. The word 'Laguna' catches your eye with the larger font, it is simple yet effective. The words 'garden pond design' is in between two                        lines which gives it a nice balance throughout the picture. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="nav">
                  <h2>Navigation Bar</h2>
            <img src="images/nav.PNG"  alt="nav" id="nav">
                <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
                <p>Designed for a younger 'hip' crowd who is into films. The target audience would be younger adults approximately between the ages of 18 and 35. They like quick answers, therefore the navigation bar needs to be simple and to the point. </p>
                <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
                <p>The clients goal is to inform the user of their work and how to contact them. The user is most likely wanting to know more about the client on a personal level and visited this site.</p>
                <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
                <p>The first thing you notice is the logo on the left hand side with an elegant font and a subtle change in color. The way the lines are setup for the navigation bar gives the appearance that they are                          buttons even though the lines don’t connect your eyes still connect them anyways. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="login">
              <h2>Login Form</h2>
                <img src="images/login.png"  alt="login" id="login">
                <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
                <p> Designed for adults who are interested in a good bargain. The target audience would be adults approximately between the ages of 18 and 65. If the adult is planning on staying at a hotel, they are probably middle to upper class, but at the same time need to save money when they can so they can spend the rest on their vacation.</p>
                <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
                    <p>The clients goal is to get the user to sign up for their offer while the user is looking for great deals for their next hotel stay.</p>
                <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
                <p>The design is simple yet effective. The header is stating exactly what you are signing up for the larger bold font. With the text in the input boxes, it makes things easier for the user to know what to                      expect when they press the big orange button after they are filled in.</p>
            </div>
            
             <div id="features">
                 <h2>Features</h2>
                <img src="images/features.PNG"  alt="features" id="features">
                 <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
                 <p>The target audience would be for younger adults approximately between the ages of 21 and 35. Younger adults tend to know what they want when they are on websites, so the features need to quick and to the point.</p>
                <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
                 <p>The clients goals are to show the users what they can expect from them as a company with icons and a brief description below. The user can easily look at these features and either look at the larger                       icons and know what is going on or they can read all about it. </p>
                <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
                 <p>The design is nice and simple with a light circle around each blue icon. A header below with a brief description on each of them indicating what the feature is useful in case the user isn’t sure what                       the icon means. </p>
            </div>
            
             <div id="services">
                 <h2>Services</h2>
                <img src="images/services.PNG"  alt="services" id="services">
                 <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
                 <p>Designed for adults who are interested in fashion and photography. The target audience would be for younger adults approximately between the ages of 21 and 35. For a younger crowd that is into fashion, the main services needs to look glamorous for them to stay interested. </p>
                <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
                 <p>The clients goal is show their portfolio to the users who are interested in a photo shoot.</p>
                <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
                 <p>First thing you see is the bottom of a ladies head with bright red lipstick on the left side. There are feathers coming out from the top indicating she is wearing a head piece of some kind. It is an                         effective way to get the attention of the target audience. Even though your eyes are drawn to her you quickly look to the right to notice what they have to offer for their main services. The two                             thumbnails give a great representation of what they offer. </p>
            </div>
            
             <div id="gallery">
                 <h2>Image Gallery</h2>
                <img src="images/gallery.PNG"  alt="gallery" id="gallery">
                 <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
                 <p>The target audience would be for younger couples approximately between the ages of 20 and 36. The couples looking for a wedding venue would most likely be middle to upper class. The images need to be as elegant as possible to persuade them to go with the service.</p>
                <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
                 <p>The clients goals are to show young couples all the places they can go to have their dream wedding. The user needs to find their wedding venue that will provide more than just a location. They want it                     to be elegant and memorable.</p>
                <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
                 <p> Each thumbnail has an HD image of what couples could expect their wedding to look like. With a brief description below each picture, it gives the audience a great idea of what they can look forward to.                      Below the description is an elegant design to help separate the images better.</p>
            </div>
            
             <div id="blog">
                 <h2>Blog</h2>
                <img src="images/blog.PNG"  alt="blog" id="blog">
                 <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
                 <p>Given that it is a blog, the target audience would be for a younger crowd approximately between the ages of 14 and 28. It is important to keep the website organized and well laid out in order for the younger crowd to stay interested. </p>
                <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
                 <p>The clients goal is to write about what they want on their blog to express themselves. The user will read the blogs to either get insight on the subject or express their opinions on it.</p>
                <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
                 <p>The dark background with a light font makes it very easy to read and understand. Having a profile picture on the left side the name makes it easier to know who the person writing is since we typically                       read left to right.</p>
            </div>
            
             <div id="cta">
                 <h2>CTA</h2>
                <img src="images/cta.PNG"  alt="cta" id="cta">
                 <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
                 <p>The target audience would be for adults approximately between the ages of 18 and 55.Because older people are now making purchases online, it is best to make the font larger then normal. </p>
                <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
                 <p> The clients goals are pretty clear on what they want. It would either be to have the user to book and pay online or have the user make an enquiry. Same goes for the user, they have two choices with                        the CTA. They can either book for a service and pay for it or they can make an enquiry.</p>
                <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
                 <p>The icons really help balance the CTA as a whole. Most people know what those stand for so they don’t really need to focus on the words. Having them yellow really helps the user to know where to look.                        The arrows pointing to the right help the user know that it is a button along with the rounded edges</p>
            </div>
            
             <div id="about">
                 <h2>About Us</h2>
                <img src="images/about.PNG"  alt="about" id="about">
                 <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
                 <p>The target audience would be for younger adults approximately between the ages of 21 and 35. The younger crowd is looking to learn more about the company and what the company can provide for them. </p>
                <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
                 <p>The clients goal is to inform the user about them. The user would like to get to know the company on a more personal level by reading about them.</p>
                <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
                 <p>The images running horizontal on the bottom is a great way to look at the clients. They arent all dressed the same indicating the company is for younger crowds and not for CEOs. I believe the “about                       us” header could be a little bigger to make it stand out more. </p>
            </div>
            
             <div id="contact">
                 <h2>Contact Form</h2>
                <img src="images/contact.PNG"  alt="contact" id="contact">
                 <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
                 <p>The target audience would be for adults approximately between the ages of 18 and 45.</p>
                <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
                 <p>The clients goal is to get the user to contact them with any comments or problems. Addresses and phone numbers are even shown in case the user would like to send them something, visit them personally,                     or call them instead of filling out a form.</p>
                <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
                 <p>The color and font of the addresses and phone number makes it a little hard to read on a brown background. The headers for each box shouldn’t be the same size as the content below. The form itself is                       basic and easy to use. It is spaced properly and easy to read.</p>
            </div>
            
             <div id="footer">
                 <h2>Footer</h2>
                <img src="images/footer.PNG"  alt="footer" id="footer">
                 <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
                 <p>The target audience would be for a younger crowd that uses social media approximately between the ages of 14 and 35. </p>
                <h3>Client/User Needs:</h3>
                 <p>The clients goal is to let the user interact with them through social media and have all of the websites main points on the right hand side. The user might be looking for a certain part of the website                     or to find the company on a social media website.</p>
                <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
                 <p>The icon for each social media site indicates that it will be for a younger crowd since all they are using is icons and no text indicating what those icons stand for. The 3 columns to the right, show                       that there will be listing that couldnt fit in the navigation bar and will help the user navigate even more throughout the website.</p>
